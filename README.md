## Installation

Clone from GitHub and source `uz.zsh`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/naderi/uz.git ~/.config/zsh/uz
```

Add this linbe to `~/.zshrc`

```sh
source ~/.config/zsh/uz/uz.zsh
```

## Usage

### Add Plugins

Add plugins' Github repo to `.zshrc` with `zadd`. Plugins are automatically installed on load.

```zsh
zadd zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zadd zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

By default `µz` sources `init.zsh` or `plugin_name.(zsh|plugin.zsh|zsh-theme|sh)` but you can also specify another script to the `zadd` command as follows:


```zsh
zadd username/repo script_name
```

### Manage Plugins

- `zclean`: removes plugins no longer in `.zshrc`.
- `zupdate`: update installed plugins.

### Installation Path

By default plugins are installed into `~/${UZ_PATH}/plugins`. This behavior can be changed re-setting `UZ_PLUGIN_PATH`.

```zsh
export UZ_PLUGIN_PATH=${UZ_PATH}/plugins # default
```

## Example

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
source ~/.uz/uz.zsh

zadd maxdrorigo/gitster
zadd maxrodrigo/zsh-kubernetes-contexts
zadd zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zadd zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
zadd zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

## Requirements

- `zsh`
- `git`

## Uninstall

`μz` only creates folders for the cloned modules and, by default, are self contained into the installation directory.

To uninstall remove the installation directory (`$UZ_PATH`) and the modules folder (`$UZ_PLUGIN_PATH`) if applicable.

## Other Notes

### Updating benchmark

```sh
ls -d ${UZ_PLUGIN_PATH}/*/.git
